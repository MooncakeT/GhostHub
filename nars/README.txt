These are all the .nar files for all the ghosts I have made.
.nar files are what you use to install a ghost.

If you are using SSP to run your ghosts:
1) Download the .nar file for the ghost you want
2) Drag & drop .nar file onto whatever ghost is currently running
3) The .nar file should be installed automatically
4) Right-click ghost to open menu & navigate to 'Change Ghost'option
5) Select your new ghost to switch to it!
